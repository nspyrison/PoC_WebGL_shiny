## shinyaframe is on CRAN, but you need the latest dev ver for adit to work.
remotes::install_github("micahstubbs/shinyaframe")
## May require an update `rlang`` first, which can sometimes be a pain


#### Notes:
## - May be custom to the VR headset and controls, in this case HTC Vive. 
## - running shiny app again seems to crash and restart RStudio
## - opens setup scene almost instantly, slider does only go up to 150 pts, does this imply there maybe a issue with scaling?
## - can move around in browser, but no interaction with variables.
